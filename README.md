# Price Prediction for Pharmaceutical Stocks During Covid-19 Pandemic

This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of pharmaceutical companies during the Covid-19 pandemic using machine learning algorithms. Specifically, three algorithms—Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Prophet—are compared to analyze their performance in predicting stock prices amidst drastic changes in the market.

## Description
The project aims to assess the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in predicting the stock prices of pharmaceutical companies during the Covid-19 pandemic. By comparing the predictions generated by Linear Regression, KNN, and Prophet models, insights are gained into the adaptability of these algorithms to the unprecedented market conditions caused by the pandemic.
